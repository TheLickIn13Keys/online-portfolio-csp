Tech Tip Bot is a Linus Tech Tips parody Discord bot that includes a community curated catalogue of ironic and unironic tid-bits of technical information. These 'tech tips' can be accessed via commands and the Slack Forums Integration.

Tech Tip Bot also has all the expected moderation features and a text based embed builder.
