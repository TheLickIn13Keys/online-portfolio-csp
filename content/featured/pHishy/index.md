AP CSP - 2/16/2022

A pHishy Fish Tank and its client report was a project done for Unit 2.1 Data Diligence. The project consisted of a hypothetical scenario where a company hired you to provide an IT consultation for a non-functioning fish tank. After researching and correcting the problems with the fish tank, a detailed client report was written that explains the problems and possible solutions. 

This project was completed by myself and another student. The role I chose for myself was to complete the entirety of the client report, which I did. This project was a big change from the previous projects we worked on in AP CSP and it did alot to teach the non-code aspects of computer science, which is really important if you plan on working in the industry.
