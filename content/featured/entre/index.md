MagiCarp is a mobile application developed for the 2022 Entrepreneurship Project that aids users that have RSIs (repetitive stress injuries) such as carpal tunnel, tendonitis, and burstitis, and MagiCarp will reccomend products through Amazon affiliate links to the user based on their specific RSI injury. MagiCarp will also perform an assessment regarding the user's pain level, and it will provide videos from accreddited medical professionals of specific stretches/exercises the user can perform to relieve pain from their RSI injury. MagiCarp will also have a community chat where users can discuss the validity of certain exercises and ergonomic products, and the app also includes a work timer where users can perform the reccomended stretches during their work break.

As a part of the MagiCarp team, I developed the REST API backend that provides users with the aformentioned medical diagnosises. I also setup the project's REST API hosting on Kubernetes. This was one of the first major projects I've worked on where I could actually share the load with others, as most of the projects I had worked on in the past required a lot more work on my part. Working on this project really helped me learn a lot about what it means to work in a team environment, and the lessons I learned will stick with me for the duration of my professional career.
