- <span style="color: #FF00FF;">[GOOP House](https://goop.house/)</span> - As a lead developer for GOOP House, an LLC that serves over 3000+ customers, I learned what is was like to truly work in the industry. There is a lot more than just coding when it comes to development. Most of the time I spend working doesn't involve code at all, instead I do a lot more documenting, writing, and planning.

- <span style="color: #FF00FF;">[The Coder School](https://www.thecoderschool.com/locations/pleasanton/)</span> - Teaching at the Coder School as a Code Coach has many similar qualities as working for GOOP House. Most of my time is spent writing student reports and completing new training outside of work, due to this I only end up teaching a few hours per week.
