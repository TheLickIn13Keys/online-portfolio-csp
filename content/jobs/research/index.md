So far in High School, we've done a few career search activities.

- Los Positas Career Coah said I was Investigative, Enterprising, and Artistic. It reccomended that I get a career in the fielod of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. This is definitely something I'm interested in and is what I have the most experience with.

- Xello reccomended a career in Computer Hardware Engineering and Aerospace Engineering. This is something I'd perfer to do over something like straight computer science, as I prefer something less theoretical and more practical, like engineering.

In conclusion, I think a job where I can apply computer science to the real world would be ideal for me.
